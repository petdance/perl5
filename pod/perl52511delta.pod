=head1 Obituary

It is with great sadness we note that Kip Hampton passed away. Probably
best known as the author of the Perl & XML column on XML.com, he was a
core contributor to AxKit, an XML server platform that became an Apache
Foundation project. He was a frequent speaker in the early days at
OSCON, and most recently at YAPC::NA in Madison. He was frequently on
irc.perl.org as `ubu`, generally in the #axkit-dahut community, the
group responsible for YAPC::NA Asheville in 2011.

Kip and his constant contributions to the community will be greatly missed.

Many of the changes included in this version originated in the CPAN modules
included in Perl's core. We're grateful to the entire CPAN community for

=head1 Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the perl bug database
at L<https://rt.perl.org/> .  There may also be information at
L<http://www.perl.org/> , the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the L<perlbug> program
included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of C<perl -V>,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then see
L<perlsec/SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION>
for details of how to report the issue.
